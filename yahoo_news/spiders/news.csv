['Andrew Tate Reveals How Much Bitcoin He’s Had Seized by Authorities'],"Shock Instagram influencer and ex-kickboxer Andrew Tate was  arrested  on human trafficking and rape charges in December.  Authorities in Romania—where the British-American lives—have since  seized  millions of dollars-worth of luxury cars, homes, and watches.  But what about his  Bitcoin ? Tate, who  boasted  about scamming men via his webcam business and had a huge internet following, frequently talked about the size of his cryptocurrency stash.  Mateea Petrescu, a spokesperson for Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan (who was also arrested ), told  Decrypt  that Romanian police also confiscated hardware wallets containing digital assets.  Petrescu said Andrew Tate’s wallet contained five Bitcoin—today worth around $111,339. Tristan’s wallet held around 16 Bitcoin.  In total, that’s $467,625 worth of the asset.  Andrew Tate’s Bitcoin was held in his girlfriend’s hardware wallet, the spokesperson said—adding that it couldn’t be confirmed whether the social media star owned more crypto than has already been seized. Romanian Police told  Decrypt  they couldn’t comment.  Andrew Tate has talked about Bitcoin a lot. “You can actually control and own your money,” he said last year on Anthony Pompliano’s popular Bitcoin podcast. “How difficult is it to move serious cash? No problem with Bitcoin.”  “I’m going full crazy mister blockchain now,” he added.  On the same podcast, Tate, who grew up in Luton, U.K., talked about how much money he has made from his crypto investments. “I turned 600 grand to $12 million,” he said.  The alleged criminal was banned from social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube last year for violating their policies.  The former Big Brother contestant made misogynistic comments but gained a huge following in a short space of time—largely because others would reshare clips of him on platforms like TikTok.  Tate managed webcam models in Romanian but prosecutors have since hit him with rape charges. They claim the two brothers wanted to “transform” women who worked for them “into slaves”,  according  to a  Reuters  report which cites court documents."
"[""Buffett's firm buys Apple, slashes chipmaker and bank stakes""]","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett's company added to its already substantial Apple investment at the end of last year while slashing a new investment in computer chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor and two longtime bank holdings. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. revealed several changes to its stock portfolio in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. Many investors follow the company's moves closely because of Buffett's remarkably successful investing record over the decades. Berkshire picked up nearly 21 million more shares in the iPhone maker during the final three months of last year to give it 915.6 million shares at the end of 2022. Buffett has called Apple one of the four giants that drive Berkshire's results even though it is only a stock investment. Berkshire's other main drivers are companies that it owns outright: its insurance unit that includes Geico, its energy company that owns several major utilities, and BNSF railroad. During the quarter, Berkshire slashed its investments in Taiwan Semiconductor, US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon. Just three months after revealing a 60 million-share stake in the chipmaker, Berkshire cut its Taiwan Semiconductor investment down to 8.3 million shares. Berkshire also cut its US Bancorp investment drastically from 52.5 million shares to 6.7 million by the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway cut its investment in Bank of New York Mellon again and sold off more than 37 million shares during the quarter to leave it with just over 25 million shares of the bank. The quarterly filings Berkshire submitted Tuesday don't make clear which investments Buffett is responsible for and which ones were made by the company's two other investment managers, but Buffett generally handles all of Berkshire's biggest investments worth $1 billion or more. Buffett doesn't regularly comment on these stock filings. Berkshire also added to one of its smaller investments that it  first revealed three months ago  when it picked up more than 1.2 million Louisiana Pacific shares to give it control of nearly 10% of that maker of building products. During the quarter, Buffett continued to trim Berkshire's investment in Activision Blizzard to 52.7 million shares. He has said that he bought that stock as a way to bet that Microsoft's  acquisition  of the video game maker will  ultimately go through . The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate Buffett leads also trimmed its investments in the grocer Kroger and Ally Financial. Buffett's  biggest investment  over the past year in oil producer Occidental Petroleum remained unchanged during the quarter. Berkshire held 194.4 million Occidental shares and warrants to buy another 83.9 million shares at the end of the year. Berkshire did pick up nearly 2 million more Chevron shares during the quarter to give it control of 8.7% of the oil giant. One of the biggest changes in Berkshire's portfolio isn't reflected in the SEC filings because its investment in Chinese electric car maker BYD is held on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Since August, Berkshire has  sold off 95 million  of the 225 million BYD shares it bought back in 2008. Besides stocks, Berkshire owns an eclectic mix of dozens of different manufacturing, retail and service businesses. Related Quotes"
['‘Hate’ your family? Dave Ramsey says this is a perfect way to show them — and potentially leave them with a huge bill too'],"Only 33% of American adults have made a formal estate plan for what will happen after they die, according to a 2022 survey from Caring.com. This must mean the remaining two-thirds of Americans “hate” their families — well, not really, but personal finance expert Dave Ramsey isn’t afraid to ruffle a few feathers to make an important point. Centibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don’t waste your money on a new car or household purchase: invest in these 3 better recession-proof buys instead Americans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mind The shocking brands behind Costco’s Kirkland label “If you hate the people in your family, leave unclear instructions and no will. Because they will all fight [for] the rest of their lives over your crap,” he said on the Ramsey Show. “If you love them, do the opposite,” quipped his co-host Kristina Ellis, a personal finance author and college finance expert. The dynamic duo shared an 11-second clip of their commentary on TikTok, amassing over 65,000 likes and hundreds of comments — many of them alluding to post-death family drama. The caption on the video provides more straight-up Ramsey advice: “​​If you’re over 18 and breathing (which is probably the case since you’re reading this), you need a will! “If you die without a will, now your loved ones are grieving, they’re scared, and they’re headed for probate court.” He should have added: And they’ll be financially out of pocket. According to a new  report  from Empathy, a platform that helps families navigate bereavement, it takes just over a year to resolve all financial matters after a loss — and the bills can escalate quickly. The study, which is based on a survey of 1,485 respondents who experienced the loss of an immediate family member in the last five years, found that funerals are a  major cause of financial strain , costing an average of $7,848 in 2022. Then there’s the lifetime of financial dealings that need to be resolved. Every debt must be settled, every asset passed on legally to new owners and every partnership dissolved. For the loved ones left behind, the process can be emotionally and mentally exhausting. When you’re grieving, the last thing you want to do is have to decide what to do with the house and its contents. And negotiating with family members can lead to disputes — that can cost the family precious time and money. And the inflated cost of dying is about to become a major problem for American families, according to the Empathy team. “A growing, aging population,  inflation , growing wealth disparity, and regressive social welfare policies mean that the impacts of loss will be felt more and more in the years to come.” Read more :  Here's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare? Of all financial matters relating to death, the most expensive and the most challenging, according to Empathy, is the probate process, which validates and administers a deceased person’s estate. The average family spent $4,967 on probate matters in 2022, but that process can get far more complicated — and expensive — when the deceased hasn’t left clear instructions. While having a will in place won’t protect your loved ones from the emotional distress of your passing, getting your basic documents in place can shield them from any extra financial anxiety, stress and uncertainty. A will is the bedrock of a strong estate plan. While the laws governing these documents vary by state, there are several basic elements that should be included: Personal information : You should include your full legal name (and any other aliases you go by), date of birth, address and the names of your immediate family. Last will and testament language : Also known as testamentary intent, this legal language declares that your document is a valid will that should be carried out. Assets : Your will details who gets what after you die, so you should list any money, personal belongings, real estate and other high-value assets that you want to distribute. Beneficiaries : Your beneficiaries are the people who will receive your assets when you die. They can be your family members, friends, charities, businesses, or even a trust — but you need to be specific about who gets what. Executor : You should pick someone to carry out the terms of your will and manage any unresolved affairs, like paying bills and taxes. If you don’t name an executor, someone will have to apply to handle your estate via probate court, or the court will name an executor. Guardianship : If you have children under the age of 18 or any disabled or elderly dependents, you can appoint them a legal guardian. Signatures : You’ll need to sign your will and most states also require witness signatures. And remember, you should update your will as your life changes, like say you get married, divorced or become a parent. You can get help from an estate lawyer but it comes at a cost. On average, a flat fee for a simple will ranges between $300 to $400, according to Willful, but the fee can climb beyond $1,000 if your will is complex. Still, Ramsey’s team would argue the benefits outweigh the potential risks associated with dying without a will. “If you’re anything like the average American, you spend hundreds a month on entertainment,” the Ramsey Solutions team shared on Tiktok. “So, why not spend a small portion of that (and just once) on a document that’ll give you peace and protect your family’s future instead?” Goldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — they think you should put 33% of your wealth in this asset instead The US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund Earn extra cash for your weekend with these quick money hacks This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

"[""Bill Gates Asked Why He's Buying So Much US Farmland: Here's His Answer In Free-For-All AMA""]","Microsoft founder and billionaire turned philanthropist  Bill Gates  recently laid to rest the long-time conspiracy theory that he owns some 80% of all U.S. farmland in his 11th appearance in an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA)  session  on Reddit. What Happened:  Gates, answering dozens of questions over the course of a few hours during the AMA, including: “Why are you buying up so much farmland, do you think this is a problem with billionaire wealth and how much you can disproportionally acquire?” In response, he said, “I own less than 1/4000 of the farmland in the US. I have invested in these farms to make them more productive and create more jobs. There isn't some grand scheme involved - in fact all these decisions are made by a professional investment team.” While Gates has spent billions investing in farm properties to make them more productive,  new companies  have innovated ways for the retail investor to  earn passive income  in the real estate market. Here’s how to  invest as little as $100  (or more, depending on your appetite) in a rental property to earn passive income and  build long-term wealth . Last year, conspiracy theorists claimed that the Microsoft founder was buying up farmland in the U.S. in order to starve Americans for an unknown reason, Snopes  said , after researchers said in April that the world was facing a potential food shortage as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

"[""'I'm part of the solution': Bill Gates says he will keep using private jets, campaigning on climate change — after being asked if he's a hypocrite. Here are 3 actions he wants you to take""]","Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has been a vocal advocate for addressing climate change. But like many of the ultra-rich, he also travels in a private jet, which emits quite a bit of greenhouse gas. Does that mean he’s a hypocrite? BBC journalist Amol Rajan confronted Gates with the question in an interview earlier this month. You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis) Centibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don’t waste your money on a new car or household purchase: invest in these 3 better recession-proof buys instead The shocking brands behind Costco’s Kirkland label “What do you say to the charge that if you are a climate change campaigner, but you also travel around the world in a private jet, you’re a hypocrite?” Rajan asked bluntly. “Well, I buy the gold standard of, funding Climeworks, to do direct air capture that far exceeds my family’s carbon footprint,” Gates replied. “And I spend billions of dollars on climate innovation. So you know, should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” “I'm comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy Group is spending, that I'm part of the solution,” the Microsoft co-founder added. Of course, you don’t need to be a billionaire to help fight climate change. In his book  How to Avoid a Climate Disaster , Gates detailed the actions that we, as consumers, can take to move humanity closer to a zero-carbon future. Here’s a look at three of them. Gates suggests that you can lower your home’s emissions by making it more energy efficient. “Depending on how much money and time you can spare, you can replace your incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs, install a smart thermostat, insulate your windows, buy efficient appliances, or replace your heating and cooling system with a heat pump (as long as you live in a climate where they can operate),” he writes. In fact, there are benefits to doing this even beyond saving the environment. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, LED bulbs consume up to 90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and can last up to 25 times longer. The department estimates that by switching to LED lighting, the average household can save about $225 in energy costs per year. Sealing and insulating is another strategy that can lower your carbon footprint – and utility bills. We all know that conditioning is a big part of why energy bills are high in the summer. So you don’t want that nice cool air in your house to escape — or that hot, humid summer air to enter. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that by air sealing your house and adding insulation, homeowners can save about 15% on heating and cooling costs, or an average of 11% on their total energy costs. You can use caulk for cracks and openings around door and window frames. You can also try weatherstripping to seal movable components such as doors and windows. Read more :  Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Compared to vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, EVs have zero tailpipe emissions. So it’s no surprise that they have gotten Gates’ attention. “Although they might not be right for everyone (they’re not great for lots of long-distance road trips, and charging at home isn’t convenient for everyone), they’re becoming more affordable for many consumers,” he writes. Gates explains that consumer behavior can change the supply side of things: “If people buy lots of them, companies will make lots of them.” He would be glad to see that EVs have indeed been gaining popularity in America. In 2022, sales of fully electric vehicles totaled 807,180 in the U.S., making up 5.8% of all cars sold, an increase from 3.2% in 2021, according to market research firm Motor Intelligence. Investors have also embraced this trend. EV giant Tesla commands a market cap of over $590 billion, which is several times bigger than Ford and General Motors  combined . We are seeing more than more plant-based protein products on store shelves these days. Gates suggests you try them, even though they might not taste as good as real meat. “I’ll admit that veggie burgers haven’t always tasted great, but the new generation of plant-based protein alternatives is better and closer to the taste and texture of meat than their predecessors.” People choose plant-based protein for a variety of reasons, including health concerns, and ethical and environmental considerations. Gates points to the environmental aspect. “Eating a meat substitute (or simply not eating meat) just once or twice a week will cut down on the emissions you’re responsible for,” he writes, adding that “the same goes for dairy products.” As with electric cars, Gates believes that purchasing plant-based protein products “sends a clear message that making them is a wise investment.” But investors might not be thrilled about this sector at the moment. Beyond Meat, a leading plant-based meat company, saw its net revenue decline 22.5% year over year in Q3 of its fiscal 2022. Shares have plunged 72% over the last 12 months.

"[""Fed's Williams calls to 'stay the course' on rate hikes after inflation data""]","New York Fed President John Williams said Tuesday inflation remains his number one concern, adding the Fed will stay the course on raising rates until the central bank achieves its 2% inflation goal. ""We will we stay the course until our job is done,"" Williams  said in a speech  at the New York Bankers Association in New York on Tuesday. ""We must restore balance to the economy and bring inflation down to 2 percent on a sustained basis."" Williams said declines in commodity and goods prices are not be enough to bring inflation back down to 2%, adding the Fed will need to see inflation in the services sector come down. ""We need all the gears turning at the right pace to restore balance between demand and supply in the entire economy,"" said Williams. ""We still have some way to go to achieve that goal."" Williams' comments  came just hours after the latest inflation data  showed consumer prices in January rose 0.5% from the prior month, the most since Oct. 2022. On an annual basis, prices rose 6.4% against the prior year, the slowest annual increase since Oct. 2021. Williams said as higher interest rates work through the economy, he expects inflation as measured by the price consumption expenditures will drop to 3% this year before moving closer to 2% in the next few years. Elsewhere on Tuesday, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan  said  she didn't think the Fed should lock in a particular level at which interest rates should peak or a precise path of rates. ""When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook,"" Logan  said in a speech  at Prairie View A&M University on Tuesday. ""I anticipate we will need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way."" Logan said she would also keep a pulse on financial conditions and said the Fed should be prepared to raise rates for a longer than expected. ""We must remain prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions,"" said Logan. Logan reiterated that even after the Fed feels no further rates hikes are needed, the central banks needs to remain flexible to raise rates if needed in case the economy or financial conditions loosen. As of December, the Fed penciled in rates peaking in a range of 5%-5.25%, though Williams warned last week rates could move higher if financial conditions loosen or inflation jets back up, while Fed Chair Powell hasn't ruled out raising rates above that level, either. Following Tuesday's inflation data, markets were pricing in a better than 90% chance the Fed raises rates another 0.25% in March, bringing its target range to 4.75%-5%,  according to data from the CME Group .

['California’s housing shortage is so bad a university is considering a floating barge as a dorm. Students call it a ‘prison boat’'],"California is home to sun, surf, and one of the most intense housing shortages in the country. Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned on the promise to build millions of housing units, but as of November of last year, he was  only 13%  toward his ultimate goal, and that’s counting permits rather than builds. All kinds of solutions have been put forward by housing advocates, from  tiny homes  to selling homes to  affordable housing  nonprofits, to the simplest of all:  zoning reform  that allows more density. But maybe the most unusual solution yet has just been floated—literally. Cal Poly Humboldt in Northern California is considering putting its students up on a barge eight miles away from campus, the  San Francisco Chronicle  reported. “There are simply not enough housing options available either on campus or in the community,” Cal Poly Humboldt spokesperson Grant Scott-Goforth told  Fortune  in a statement, adding that it’s also looking into three hotels to house students. This statement alone speaks to the dire housing shortage in California, as the campus is located in Arcata, a city with just around 18,000 residents, and surely enough space to keep students from the barge life. Vacancy rates in Humboldt County are reportedly  between zero and 3%,  and the state wants to build 3,390 new housing units in the county by 2017, local media outlet  North Coast Journal  reported. Officials in the nearby town of Eureka are reportedly considering building more housing on parking lots, and in Arcata they are looking at rezoning industrial land. “The idea of floating apartments or studios is one of many possibilities the university has been exploring,” Scott-Goforth said. “This is very preliminary at this point and the university does not have further details to share.” The barge would theoretically be anchored off the town of Eureka, whose city manager Miles Slattery  told the  Chronicle  that a boat could house around 600 students, and would include typical college staples like a dining hall. “I think, personally, that this is a great idea,” Slattery told the  Lost Coast Post , a local news outlet. “It would be a huge benefit to the City of Eureka, our businesses, to have this available.” The California housing crisis has hit Humboldt students hard. The school plans to increase its enrollment over the next few years but is already putting students up in affordable hotels like the  Comfort Inn , rather than traditional college dorms. Many students  have attended rallies to raise awareness about the lack of accommodation . The university updated its guidance earlier this month, saying on-campus housing will not be offered to returning students, Humboldt student paper  The Lumberjack  reported, though it has since  walked back that move .  “I can’t fathom why you guys are accepting this many students when you can’t support them,” student Julia Kurtz  said at a protest . Some students have started referring to the barge  idea as a “prison boat ,” a reference to how, historically, some boats have functioned as prisons. Although prison ships no longer exist in California, they are part of the state’s history, and a  boat on the Sacramento River  in the 1800s was one of its first prisons, although it sank in 1859. “I don’t get why some people are calling it a prison boat,” Slattery told the  Chronicle . “The facilities are amazing.” This story was originally featured on  Fortune.com More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Millennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the rest The best 5 ways to earn passive income This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home"
"['A salary below this amount is a dating deal-breaker for many Americans, survey shows — why you should talk money on your very first date']","Thinking about getting down on one knee this Valentine’s Day? Don’t make the big move without first being bold about your financial needs and goals. Financial services company Western & Southern Financial Group  surveyed over 1,000 married Americans  about their financial triggers and found that 1-in-3 couples waited until after marriage to talk about important financial topics, with salary being the biggest topic they wished they’d talked about sooner. Centibillionaire Jeff Bezos says not to waste your money on a new car or household purchase: invest in these 3 better recession-proof buys instead You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis) The shocking brands behind Costco’s Kirkland label On average, Americans said they want their partner to be making at least $29,878. Some of the most common financial deal-breakers include having outstanding personal loans and credit card debt. Financial activist Dasha Kennedy — also known as The Broke Black Girl — says couples should be having  conversations about money  as early as the very first date. Here’s why it’s important to figure out if you’re a financial match before things get serious. Kennedy, who has worked as an accountant and loan default counselor, divorced her husband after realizing they weren’t financially compatible. The  divorce left her $25,000 in debt  and took her five years to financially recover from. “Had we initiated more financial conversations in the beginning, we probably would have either decided early on that we were just not financially compatible to be in a relationship, let alone to be married.” A 2022  survey  from The Knot found that being secretive about finances or dishonest about how you’re spending your money is one of the biggest deal-breakers in a relationship. “When we look at the data, we see that not talking about money or money-related issues is one of the leading causes for divorce,” says Kennedy. “Initiating those conversations as early as possible and trying to get ahead of that curve is very important.” The Western & Southern Financial Group’s  January survey  echoed some of The Knot's findings, with their survey showing the top three financial triggers for fights in relationships came down to spending habits, investments and salary. Kennedy says she and her ex rarely spoke about money over the duration of their relationship and they always dealt with their finances separately. While Kennedy was concerned about the long-term financial goals, her ex typically focused on the present. For example, once she’d suggested they might buy  life insurance  to ensure they could always provide for their children just in case. But her ex didn’t see the point of preparing for something that “may not happen.” “I didn't feel that … I would be able to stand my ground and be confident in what I knew about money and speak my piece,” Kennedy says. “So I didn't initiate any conversations.” After the divorce, Kennedy says her financial responsibilities doubled while the household income was slashed in half — on top of the $25,000 in debt she now had to repay. She made it work, but it was tough: She downsized her apartment, took public transit instead of buying a car and bartered for services like child care that were now harder to afford. You don’t necessarily need to ask a potential partner about their salary or  what their credit score is  on the very first date. But you can bring up more general topics around money, Kennedy says. You want to get a sense of how someone views money rather than their habits, which don’t matter as much when you’re still getting to know someone. She suggests asking dates about their  relationship with money  and just seeing if they’re open to having conversations about it. “In so many ways, money exists from the very beginning,” Kennedy adds. From deciding where you’ll spend your first date, to splitting the bill and tipping — finance can find its way into your dating life without you even planning for it. Once you’re further into a relationship, you can start asking more serious questions. With Americans  feeling concerned about their financial health and salary needs , it’s important not to shy away from difficult topics. Read more:   Earn extra cash for your weekend with these quick money hacks “Along with discussing upbringing, couples should discuss financial goals, financial planning, accepting each other's financial differences, different money management practices that are fair, and creating financial boundaries,” says Kennedy. Some people may be eager to discuss money immediately, but others may need a little more time to engage. According to the new data, only 13% of married couples say they discussed salary and 6% talked about spending habits and debt, within their first month of dating. One of the most important things you can do, Kennedy says, is to approach the conversation with empathy and an open mind. “Give your partner time to show up,” she advises. “We all come from different backgrounds, different beliefs, we all have different experiences when it comes to money.” You can make it work with different money philosophies, but certain things should be non-negotiable. Kennedy warns you should be suspicious if your potential partner suddenly needs to borrow money or they consistently hide important financial details. These red flags should be especially concerning if they seem as though they’re trying to live beyond their means. However, Kennedy adds that it’s also important to be mindful of the current economic climate and how that may have impacted people’s financial situations. Living with your parents longer than usual or not owning a car and taking public transportation instead aren’t necessarily indicators of financial instability. In fact, more and more adults aged 18 to 34 are  living with their parents  in the midst of a rapidly rising cost of living. But if your financial aspirations and behaviors are completely out of sync, you might need to make the hard call and end the relationship. “It is essential to know that some financial goals and habits can be seen as deal-breakers, which is OK,” Kennedy says. “You and your partner will not always agree on everything, but that doesn't mean you have to conform to values that go against your financial morals.” You don’t have to be ultra-rich to enter the fine art market — here’s how you can get a piece of a real Picasso Americans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mind The US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — invest in this stable asset before you lose your retirement fund This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

"[""Winner of California's $2B lottery gets largest U.S. jackpot""]","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The winner of the largest U.S. lottery jackpot in history is a former student in the California public school system who wants to mostly stay out of the spotlight. California lottery officials on Tuesday said Edwin Castro won the record-breaking $2.04 billion Powerball prize in November. But they couldn't say anything else about him. State law says Castro's name is in the public record, but nothing else is — including his age and where he lives. The winning ticket was sold at Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, an unincorporated community in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles. But California Lottery winners aren't required to live in the state to win. Joe Chahayed, the owner of Joe's Service Center,  got a $1 million bonus  for selling the winning ticket. Castro declined an invitation from state officials to speak to reporters on Tuesday. Instead, he sent a written statement that said he was “shocked and ecstatic” to have won the lottery. California's lottery benefits public schools, and Castro's statement identified himself as “being educated in the California public education system."" “It's gratifying to hear that, as a result of my win, the California school system greatly benefits as well,"" he said. Winners can choose to receive their winnings over 30 annual payments or as a lump sum. State officials said Castro chose the lump sum of $997.6 million. Most people who win big lottery jackpots try to keep a low profile and avoid publicity, California Lottery Deputy Director Carolyn Becker said. But some states like to announce winners publicly to “humanize” the lottery by reminding the public that real people win real prizes. The lottery that Castro won was the largest in U.S. history because it took so long or someone to choose the correct combination of six numbers to win the prize. The Powerball jackpot starts at $20 million and increases each time there is no winner. There were more than 40 consecutive drawings before Castro's numbers were called: 10, 33, 41, 47 and 56, plus the red Powerball was 10. Becker said all of those drawings raised $156.3 million for California public schools, the most ever from a single jackpot. Altogether, the California Lottery collected $2 billion for public schools in their most recent fiscal year. “These numbers represent promises kept since voters created the lottery in 1984 with the explicit purpose and intent to raise supplemental funding for public education,” California Lottery Director Alva Johnson said. Castro's win means that three of the  10 largest lottery jackpots  in U.S. history have come from tickets sold in California. The second-largest jackpot — $1.586 billion in 2016 — matched three tickets sold in California, Florida and Tennessee. A $699.8 million ticket, good enough for the ninth largest jackpot ever, was sold in California in 2021. State officials have Castro's winning ticket. Becker said they're considering putting it on display at the lottery's headquarters."
"[""'You should be terrified': A TikToker went viral for explaining why anyone in the US making less than $25/hour is in serious trouble. He has a point. But you can prove him wrong""]","As if we don’t have enough to worry about. A recession looks more and more likely, lasting through most of this year. Inflation remains high, along with interest rates, and more and more Americans continue to  find themselves in dire financial straits . You could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis) Centibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don’t waste your money on a new car or household purchase: invest in these 3 better recession-proof buys instead The shocking brands behind Costco’s Kirkland label In a video that quickly went viral, Halbert broke down the average cost But according to financial TikTok influencer Ryan Halbert, it’s only going to get much worse. If you’re making less than $25 an hour, in fact, he says “you should be terrified.” of living in America. And it certainly is terrifying. After putting together all the typical essentials, like rent, groceries, gas and water, the total average cost came to $3,285.37 per month. Broken down to a 40-hour work week, that means you need to be making at minimum $20.50 per hour. However, what’s not included here is tax, which Halbert goes on to explain and show in a spreadsheet. Add on tax, and you’d need to make $25 an hour just to squeak into that $3,285 range, after tax comes off your paycheck. “So this gives you very limited options,” Halbert says. “You either have to kill yourself working way, way too many hours, or you’ve gotta figure out a way to make a ton of money. And also keep in mind these expenses are factoring in doing nothing. No free time, no going out to eat, no extra miles on the car, nothing.” Halbert’s video sparked an important discussion among viewers, who quickly shared the video, which now has more than 1.4 million views. Halbert discusses some of the responses, like making cuts to try and keep your costs in check. This might include your streaming services, cable, internet, cellphone and other expensive recurring costs. But Halbert goes on to say this isn’t a real solution. And he adds you’ll only ever be able to put an extra $200 or so in your pocket, adding “that will never increase, so you have to increase your income. It’s a must.” This crisis only seems to be getting worse, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Current employment statistics for November 2022 showed that real average hourly earnings fell 1.9% from November 2021. Halbert suggests  working side hustles  isn’t going to create enough income, especially if you want to retire someday. Instead, it’s going to be  investing  — he says that’s the only way. But if you ask the experts behind the YouTube channel The Ramsey Show, it’s certainly not the only way. “This is absolute nonsense,” Ken Coleman, a career coach with The Ramsey Show, commented in reference to the monthly costs presented in the TikTok video. Coleman, accompanied by George Kamel, The Ramsey Show co-host, admitted that while they realize many Americans feel this way, it’s simply inaccurate. They specifically pointed out that the average used car payment was closer to $700, but also that the average rent would be near $1,659 only in higher-cost cities. Read more :  Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds They did grant Halbert some points, including that Americans continue to hand over their “hard-earned cash” to lenders. “They think, ‘Well, this is the path, this is how I get financial freedom, this is what success looks like.’ But we teach no debt. Pay for things with cash, get reasonable used cars. So this is a big part of the picture of why there’s no margin in this person’s budget,” said George Kamel. But where the pair really had an issue was that the only solution was to “kill yourself working,” or accept this fate. That’s because what Halbert doesn’t cover in his videos are  real solutions to cost savings . For example, the pair feel you shouldn’t be paying $1,659 in rent as a single person. Instead, they suggest you find at least one roommate to cut costs in half. Or sell that  car you can’t afford , Kamel suggested. In the end, Coleman says that usually these are simply periods in your life that you need to get through on your path to financial freedom. “This isn’t a sentence. This is a season of your life, but it’s not a life sentence.” It's always worthwhile to cut down on your monthly bills as much as you can — no matter how much you make. Unfortunately, your mortgage payments and utility bills are non-negotiable. But there is one bill you  can  do something about: Home insurance. Case in point: Local homeowners in Washington state often save close to $1,000 or more per year by shopping around for their insurance — according to nonprofit consumer group Puget Sound Consumers’ Checkbook. Normally, shopping around for insurance quotes takes forever and it's a hassle to field multiple phone calls from different insurance agents. But now you can find the lowest prices on home insurance online, and it  only takes three minutes . The average price of a home insurance policy in 2022 was $1,680 — nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago. Rates are expected to keep rising in 2023 so the  time to act is now  to make sure you are getting the best price possible your policy.

"['Nikkei slides amid hawkish Fed, stronger yen; earnings split market']","By Kevin Buckland TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average sank on Wednesday, reversing a small early gain, as a strengthening yen weighed on sentiment and investors digested hawkish Federal Reserve comments following a closely watched U.S. inflation report. Domestic earnings also continued to split the market, with internet company Recruit Holdings slumping 3.6% to be among the biggest drags, while online retailer Rakuten Group swung from an initial 3.8% drop to soar 5%. Citizen Watch rallied for a second day on a share buyback plan, surging 9.9% to lead Nikkei gainers. The Nikkei ended the morning session down 0.4% at 27,491.51, weakening into the break after spending the early part of the session with gains of as much as 0.43%. The broader Topix slipped 0.24% to 1,988.30, after earlier rising to 1,999.66, the highest level since Dec. 1. The volatile Japanese session followed a mixed day for Wall Street, with the Dow dropping about 0.5%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 0.7% and the S&P 500 about flat. U.S. equity futures, though, pointed to a 0.5% decline at the restart. U.S. consumer prices rose at a slower pace in January, but faster than economists had forecast. Both Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and New York Fed President John Williams said overnight that the Fed still has work to do to combat inflation. U.S. Treasury yields jumped, with the 10-year yield scaling 3.799% for the first time since the start of the year. ""Whether the 10-year Treasury yield keeps to a range, whether it falls back or whether it takes another step higher, that will probably be a major differentiator for the direction of equities,"" said Kazuo Kamitani, a Nomura strategist. A stronger yen was also weighing on Japanese stocks, Kamitani said, with the currency last up 0.2% at 132.82 per dollar and 0.3% stronger at 142.45 per euro . Of the Nikkei's 225 components, 109 rose versus 108 that fell, with eight flat. Among the index's sub-sectors, financials rose the most, adding 1.3% as higher long-term bond yields boosted their revenue outlook. Real estate led laggards, sliding 0.9%.

"[""e.l.f. makeup brand 'one of the best positioned in beauty,' analyst says""]","e.l.f. Beauty ( ELF ) reported another strong quarter that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company grew net sales by 49% in the fiscal third quarter, marking its  16th straight quarter  of net sales growth. ""It did very well last year, but we think that they have continued momentum,"" Olivia Tong, managing director and senior consumer staples analyst at Raymond James, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above) ahead of the earnings release. ""So we think they're one of the best positioned in beauty because they have relatively manageable price points and still a lot of market share opportunity to gain."" e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin highlighted the market share gains in color cosmetics during the earnings call. “We grew our market share by 150 basis points and increased our rank to the No. 4 brand as compared to No. 5 a year ago,” Amin said. “We continue to be the fastest-growing top-five brand by a wide margin.” Amin attributed the glowing quarter to the brand's value proposition, innovation in the industry, and marketing efforts, especially as the beauty industry sees a post-pandemic shift in consumer spending. From an affordability standpoint, Amin pointed to several ""holy grail"" products that have attracted new customers. For instance, sales of the company's $8 Putty Primer, inspired by another prestige brand's $52 face primer, have grown by double-digits, Amin said. ""We often get questions whether our growth can be attributed to trade down from prestige or trade within from mass [market],"" the CEO added. ""While we see benefits of each, we believe the more fundamental point is that our value proposition creates accessibility, driving category expansion. We have many examples where the accessibility of our holy grail innovation significantly expanded the number of consumers who participate in a particular category."" And despite the focus on value, e.l.f. also saw a boost from price increases implemented in 2022, which lifted margins. ""Those with the higher market shares, those with a lot of innovation, they can get away with a little bit more pricing,"" Tong said. ""They can hold on to a little bit more, and people will be willing to pay a little bit more for some improved efficacy or ease of use or convenience or what have you.""

['Researchers have uncovered another complication that affects 60% of people with long COVID'],"Nearly 60% of patients with long COVID had organ impairment a year after catching the sometimes deadly disease, according to a  new study released Tuesday  by the  Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.  London-based researchers examined 536 long COVID patients, only 13% of whom were initially hospitalized with COVID. The majority—62%—were diagnosed with organ impairment six months after having COVID. The vast majority—nearly 60% of all long COVID patients studied—continued to experience organ impairment a year later. What’s more, more than a quarter saw impairment of two organs or more. Long COVID symptoms seemed generally associated with being young and female, and having single-organ impairment, Amitava Banerjee, professor of Clinical Data Science at the University College London Institute of Health Informatics, said in a news release on the findings. “Several studies confirm persistence of symptoms in individuals with long COVID up to one year,” Banerjee said. “We now add that three in five people with long COVID have impairment in at least one organ, and one in four have impairment in two or more organs—in some cases without symptoms.” The researchers were unable to determine exactly what about the COVID virus was causing long COVID symptoms, even after performing blood tests and MRIs. Currently, there are no official diagnostic criteria for long COVID. Even the definition of the condition varies depending on whom you talk to, though it’s generally considered to consist of new symptoms that start during a COVID infection or appear after one, and persist for weeks or months. With  more than 200 symptoms identified —from lingering cough and fatigue to ear numbness and a sensation of “brain on fire”—long COVID is undoubtedly not one but multiple conditions, experts say. True long COVID, some contend, is best defined as a chronic-fatigue-syndrome-like condition that develops after a COVID infection, similar to other post-viral syndromes that can occur after an infection with herpes, Lyme disease, and Ebola, among others. Other post-COVID complications like organ damage should not be defined as long COVID and better fit into the larger umbrella category of PASC, some experts say. Also known as  post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 , the term is used to encompass a wide variety of COVID consequences, from chronic-fatigue-like symptoms and subsequent  heart disease  to lasting lung damage and odd new symptoms like  urinary incontinence, itching, and skin lesions . As of Jan. 16, 15% of U.S. adults reported having long COVID symptoms at some point in the pandemic, and 6% reported lingering symptoms, according to a Jan. 26 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, citing data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The percent of Americans who’ve experienced COVID and still report long COVID symptoms dropped from 19% in June to 11% in January,  according to the report .

"[""RPT-How secret London talks led to Air India's gigantic plane order""]","(Repeats Feb. 14 story with no changes to text) * Air India seals order for close to 500 jets from Airbus, Boeing * Negotiators camped out at luxury Tata-owned London hotel * New airline owners seen as ""methodical and tough"" negotiators * GE seen as a winner after sweeping engine deals By Aditi Shah and Tim Hepher BENGALURU/PARIS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Air India's record aircraft deal has put the Tata Group-owned airline in the league of aspiring global carriers. On Tuesday, it provisionally agreed to acquire almost 500 jets from Airbus and Boeing to take on domestic and international rivals. Striking the largest ever deal by one airline took months of secret talks carried out a stone's throw from Britain's Buckingham palace and culminating in a celebration over coastal Indian curries, according to people involved in the talks. Confidentiality was lifted on Tuesday as leaders hailed the accord in a diplomatic embrace between leading G20 nations. Tata Group, which regained control of Air India last year after decades of public ownership, put out just six paragraphs. Its low-key announcement illustrates a rising breed of private airline owners transforming a financially-risky Indian airline sector, alongside the publicity-shy founders of IndiGo. The deal was in the making for over a year, insiders said, recounting details of the process on condition of anonymity. Serious talks began last summer and continued until days before Christmas when outlines were agreed. As the astonishing scale of the deal began to crystallise, Reuters reported in December the parties were nearing a record 500-plane agreement. The epicentre of dealmaking was St James' Court - a luxury Victorian hotel near Buckingham Palace in London's West End. In the hothouse atmosphere of a classic aircraft industry negotiating ritual known as a ""bake-off"", negotiators from the airline, planemakers and engine giants camped out at the Tata-owned hotel and neighbouring suites for days at a stretch. They were chasing a bigger slice of a fast-growing market that has seen many airline growth plans rise and fall. Now, Boeing had a chance to restore its position in India's single-aisle jet market and narrow Airbus' large lead. Airbus wanted a bigger piece of the wide-body market led by its rival. With bulging order books, neither could sweep the whole order. At stake was India's bid to win back the custom of visitors and its own diaspora from highly efficient Gulf carriers. Politics set the context but talks were commercial - and tough. ""The convergence of the political will of the country to regain sovereignty of international connectivity, combined with the ambition of the mighty Tata ... if things are done right it has all the ingredients to be really solid,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told Reuters on Tuesday. 'METHODICAL, TOUGH' The contest for attention played out across London on a chilly day in December as Airbus found itself in talks with Air India on one side of the capital, while fighting Qatar Airways in court over the fate of similar A350 jets just two miles away. Airbus and Qatar Airways later settled their contractual and safety row, but Air India jumped ahead of Qatar in the queue for smaller jets though sources say the Gulf airline also won hefty damages. Negotiations led by Air India's chief commercial and transformation officer, Nipun Aggarwal, and Yogesh Agarwal, head of aircraft acquisitions, often stretched into the night with sellers churning out new ""best offers"" fuelled by room service. ""Air India negotiated hard and the team is very sharp despite having no prior aviation experience. They compare with some of the best dealmakers in the business,"" one person said. A second person who watched the billions fall into place said the Air India negotiators were ""methodical, tough and very sophisticated"". The London negotiations ended with a dinner at the hotel's Michelin-starred Indian restaurant Quilon, renowned for its seafood and coastal cuisine from places like Goa and Kerala. While the major focus in any jet deal is the battle between planemakers, engines are often key and can speed or hold up the wider deal. Plans for announcements on the anniversary of Tata's Air India takeover slipped as engine talks wore on. The biggest overall winner, insiders say, is General Electric which picks up the lion's share of the lucrative engine deals, with its CFM joint-venture with Safran beating Raytheon-owned rival Pratt & Whitney on Airbus A320neos. Rolls-Royce also got a boost from the sale of 40 Airbus A350s. Highlighting the long road to strategic deals in aviation, GE's victory had been in the making for about 10 years. In 2014, it won a tender for 27 engines for Air India A320s. Soon after it convinced Vistara to take on its engines for seven aircraft which later translated into an order for 70 planes. The turning point was IndiGo, which switched from Pratt & Whitney after technical issues that Pratt says have been resolved. Analysts caution many obstacles remain to Air India's plans. It needs better service and efficiency to make a serious dent in the powerfully entrenched hubs of Doha and Dubai. But India's potential will continue to lure dealmakers. CAPA India reports IndiGo is exploring its own order for 500 jets. (Reporting by Aditi Shah, Tim Hepher; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise) Related Quotes"
"['Asia Stocks Set for Choppy Open on CPI, Fed Speak: Markets Wrap']","(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia are primed for a cautious open after a choppy day on Wall Street ended flat as investors balanced hot inflation data with Federal Reserve commentary suggesting US interest rates may soon peak.

Equity futures in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong inched higher. The S&P 500 was unchanged while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is more sensitive to higher interest rates, rose 0.7%, underscoring the muted optimism. Australian and New Zealand bond yields climbed higher. The two-year Treasury yield rose 10 basis points to the highest level since November, while the 10-year rose four basis points to levels not seen since the start of the year. The moves were driven by US CPI data that showed prices rose 0.5% in January, more than the 0.4% forecast by economists, and subsequent comments from policymakers. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said the the Fed was nearing the point where rates were restrictive enough. “In my view, we are not done yet,” he said. “But we are likely close.” Harker’s Richmond Fed counterpart Thomas Barkin told Bloomberg TV that the central bank might “have to do more”to fight inflation and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said rate increases could last “for a longer period than previously anticipated.” Equity bulls were also encouraged by one falling component of the CPI print. Core services minus housing, a measure singled out by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the past, came in at a slower 0.3% pace in the month. “Stocks are probably rising due to Harker,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Close to done on tightening is vague, but certainly not a hawkish tone.” The dollar was largely unchanged and the yen opened flat after weakening over the past two days. Oil fell for a second day after the announcement that the US was selling more crude from its strategic reserves.
